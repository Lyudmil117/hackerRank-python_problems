# hackerRank-python_problems
Here i was practisinig lists and functions before the start of my SoftUni Fundamentals coarse.
At a moment i felt that i need more practise in order to solve more complicated tasks flawlesly, 
so i searched the net i got some tasks from multiple sites.
Most of the tasks are quite simple, but as a complete beginner and pre coarse that made me way better using 
the list functions and methods, while solving lately more complicated stuff.
